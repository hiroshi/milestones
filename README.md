About proxy.js
--------------
This app is designed as a front end javascript only single page app, however [current version of the Backlog API v2 doesn't support CORS and/or JSONP](http://feedback.backlog.jp/forums/140671/suggestions/6734925). proxy.js will proxy Ajax request from front to [backlog API v2](http://developer.nulab-inc.com/ja/docs/backlog/api/2/).
